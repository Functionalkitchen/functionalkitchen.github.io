Let’s explore the magic of native plants and how they can transform your garden into a low-maintenance oasis.\nNative Plants: A Symphony of Benefits Effortless Beauty: Native plants require less watering and fertilizing, making them ideal for busy homeowners seeking a low-maintenance landscape.

Purpose and Placement: Determine the purpose of the planting area (e.g., privacy screen, ground cover) and select plants accordingly.
